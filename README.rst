"Introduction to Vue.js" Companion Code
=======================================

This is the companion code for the article "Introduction to Vue.js" published in
the August 2017 issue of Digit.

This code is best used as a reference when writing your own project. Avoid
copy-pasting the code. Instead try to follow the instructions in the article and
refer to the code if you feel something is not working as expected.

This project is organised in separate branches for each step taken in the
article, with a few extra comments thrown in. You should see a dropdown showing
**"Branch: master"** in the GitHub UI; you can use that to switch branches.

This repository contains some extra files can be useful for users who are
familiar with Node, and npm. If you are such a user, you can clone this
repository and run ``npm install`` followed by ``npm start`` to launch the app
in your default browser. This will use `browser-sync`_ to run a web server that
serves the app, and will automatically refresh the browser whenever you make
a change to your app.

If you are not familiar with Node and npm and just want to check out the app
code, you only need to concern yourself with ``index.html``, and ``app.js``.
